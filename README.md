# SimPA corpus
This is the first release of the SimPA corpus. It contains:
- 1,100 original sentences
- 3,300 lexical simplifications (3 for each original sentence)
- 1,100 syntactic simplifications (1 for each original sentence)

The lexical and syntactic simplifications were done in two steps. Firstly, sentences were lexically simplified by volunteers. Then, a set of the lexically simplified sentences were syntactically simplified (also by volunteers).
